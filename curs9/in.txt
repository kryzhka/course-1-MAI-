1 0 Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
2 1 And sorry I could not travel both
3 2 And be one traveler, long I stood
4 3 And looked down one as far as I could
5 4 To where it bent in the undergrowth.
6 5 Then took the other, as just as fair,
7 6 And having perhaps the better claim,
8 7 Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
9 8 Though as for that the passing there
10 9 Had worn them really about the same.
11 10 And both that morning equally lay
12 11 In leaves no step had trodden black.
13 12 Oh, I kept the first for another day!
14 13 Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
15 14 I doubted if I should ever come back.
16 15 I shall be telling this with a sigh
17 16 Somewhere ages and ages hence:
18 17 Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
19 18 I took the one less traveled by,
20 19 And that has made all the difference.
